        "How do I know if my email has been breached?": "You can use tools like BreachCheck to check if your email has been involved in a known data breach.",
        "What should I do if my password has been pwned?": "Change your password immediately and consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.",
        "Is it safe to use BreachCheck?": "Yes, BreachCheck does not store any data and all interactions occur locally on your device.",
        "Can I check multiple passwords at once?": "Yes, you can enable the multi-check option in the password section to check multiple passwords at once.",
        "What is a password manager?": "A password manager is a tool that helps you generate, store, and manage your passwords securely.",
